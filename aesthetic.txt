Aesthetic change for whack a mole:

The aim was to create a sense of urgency and rapid gameplay. 
The placement of a timer would mean that the player has to hit the moles as quickly as possible to get a higher score. 
The movement of the sun across the screen would reinforce this feeling along with a countdown clock for emphasis.
